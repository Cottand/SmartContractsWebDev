                    <p class="lead" style="padding-top: 15px">In today’s society contracts are an integral part of
                        everyday life.
                        When we buy, sell, trade or offer assets contracts are made, contested and signed in the
                        background.
                        However, now contracts are becoming bigger and bigger and much more complicated, requiring
                        third-party help to ensure the contracts are not broken.
                        The resolution to this problem is smart contracts.</p>

                    <h2>What?</h2>
                    <p class="lead">In simple terms smart contracts are small computer programs stored inside of a
                        blockchain.
                        Blockchain is a distributed ledger, in other words a chain of information blocks, that cannot
                        be tempered with.
                        Since smart contracts are stored inside of a blockchain everything is immutable and
                        distributive.
                        Being immutable means that once a smart contract is created it cannot be changed, overcoming
                        the problem of sabotage.
                        Being distributive means that the output of the smart contract has to be validated by everyone
                        on the network so a single person cannot force a contract to end, so it becomes almost
                        impossible to tamper with.</p>

                    <h2>One of many uses</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Autonomation is a goal shared by many companies and organisations, many have
                        achieved autonomation along the production line using robots to manufacture goods and carry out
                        services.
                        However, imagine if companies could autonomously buy and sell resources.
                        Companies would spend less time negotiating on a term of trade and Artificial Intelligence
                        could be used to optimally negotiate a deal for both parties.
                        For this to become a reality companies need to be able to autonomously communicate between each
                        other, create and sign a smart contract.</p>
                    <div><img src="pics/diagram.png" alt="A diagram" width="786" height="480"></div>
                    <p class="lead">This diagram shows negotiation between two firms resulting in a smart contract,
                        that contains the term of agreement.
                        For example, consider a software development firm that creates simulation software for
                        electronic equipment design let’s call it “ElectronicSim” and an electronics manufacturing firm
                        such as Apple, Samsung or Dell but let’s call it “PCforU”.
                        ElectronicSim may agree to license 50 copies of their simulation software for 1-year to PCforU
                        at a price of $50,000 per copy.
                        This is the implementation of the terms of agreement encoded in the smart contract.
                        Before the smart contract is made both firms create specifications containing logical
                        statements that are used to test against the terms of the contract.
                        For example, PCforU’s specification may contain a logic statement “ElectronicSim will license
                        50 copies of simulation software for 1-year”.
                        Likewise, ElectronicSim's specification might contain the statement "PCforU will pay $2,500,000
                        in total for the year".
                        This statement is then tested against the contract returning true or false.
                        This ensures that both parties get what they want from the contract.
                        Once the final smart contract is verified by both parties it can be deployed on the blockchain
                        and be used.</p>
