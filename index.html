                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <p class="lead">In todayâ€™s society contracts are an integral part of everyday life.
                  When we buy, sell, trade or offer assets contracts are made, contested and signed in the background.
                  However, now contracts are becoming bigger and bigger and much more complicated, requiring third-party help to ensure the contracts are not broken.
                  The resolution to this problem is smart contracts.</p>
                <h2>What?</h2>
                <p class="lead">In simple terms smart contracts are small computer programs stored in side of a blockchain.
                  Blockchain is a distributed ledger, in other words a chain of information blocks, that cannot be tempered with.
                  Since smart contracts are stored inside of a blockchain everything is immutable and distributive.
                  Being immutable means that once a smart contract is created it cannot be changed, overcoming the problem of sabotage.
                  Being distributive means that the output of the smart contract has to be validated by everyone on the network so a single person cannot force a contract to end, so it becomes almost impossible to tamper with.</p>
                <h2>One of many uses</h2>
                <p class="lead">Autonomation is a goal shared by many companies and organisations, many have achieved autonomation along the production line using robots to manufacture goods and carry out services.
                  However, imagine if companies could autonomously buy and sell resources.
                  Companies would spend less time negotiating on a term of trade and Artificial Intelligence could be used to optimally negotiate a deal for both parties.
                  For this to become a reality companies need to be able to autonomously communicate between each other, create and sign a smart contract.</p>
