                    <p class="lead">XCLAIM is a protocol that enables cross-chain interoperability
                        of cryptocurrencies. The idea is to issue tokens from one blockchain on
                        another chain without any trusted intermediaries. Instead, the intermediaries
                        are incentivized to behave honestly through collateral. Proofs of honest and
                        malicious behaviour is achieved through transaction inclusion proofs. This is
                        the first trustless cross-chain interoperability protocol with such strong
                        guarantees and without the need to either trust a third-party or bootstrap a
                        permissioned blockchain as intermediary.</p>

                    <h2>A specification language for smart contract verification</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Smart contracts are still prone to security vulnerabilities. Apart
                        from using automated tools to verify for known bugs, it can be beneficial to
                        verify that a smart contract is correct with respect to some specification.
                        However, using formal verification tools is mostly combined with a steep
                        learning curve and requires a deep understanding of the tools. This projects
                        aims to develop a domain-specific language for writing specifications to
                        verify smart contracts. The idea is to abstract away some of the complexities
                        so that formal verification can become a standard tool for smart contract
                        developers.

                    <p class="lead">
                        In this project, a Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
                        protocol was used to realise a linear regression and a shallow neural
                        network implementation without reveling input data of the
                        participants in the protocol.

                        <br>
                        Multi-Party Computation allows decentralised systems to process data from, say Alice and Bob
                        without letting Alice see Bob's input and vice-versa, but allowing them both to see the output
                        of the computation. In this project Florian Apfelbeck set up a MPC protocol that was used to
                        realise a linear regression and a shallow neural
                        network implementation without reveling input data of the
                        participants in the protocol, aiming to achieve privacy in machine learning.

                    <h2>Layered TCR</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Layer 2 protocols on Ethereum typically use collateral to prevent agents to misbehave. This
                        includes for example Plasma, payment channels (Raiden, PERUN), verifiable computation (TrueBit)
                        or cross-chain protocols like XClaim. There are two problems with the current approach to
                        collateral: unknown risk and depency on outside events.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The idea of a Verifiable Layered TCR (VLTCR) is to assign agents into layers based on their
                        actions. A cryptoeconomic protocol has in an abstract sense a list of desired and undesired
                        actions. In case an agent performs an undesired action, its collateral is usually "slashed",
                        i.e. the collateral is destroyed or the "victim" of the undesired action is refunded with that
                        collateral. Contrary, if the agent performs a desired action, it is usually rewarded with a fee
                        that the consumer of the service is paying (e.g. a solver in TrueBit).

                    <p class="lead">
                        Scalability of distributed ledgers is a key adoption factor. As an alternative to
                        blockchain-based protocols, directed acyclic graph (DAG) protocols are proposed with the
                        intention to allow a higher volume of transactions to be processed. However, there is still
                        limited understanding of the behaviour and security considerations of DAG-based systems.

                        This paper presents an asynchronous, continuous time, and multi-agent simulation framework for
                        DAG-based cryptocurrencies. Honest and semi-honest actors were modeled in the system to analyse
                        the behaviour of one specific cryptocurrency, IOTA.
